# UNDERGRADUATE DISSERTATION PROJECT

## Overview

This project presents a comparative analysis of CPython and Mojo for evaluating both performance and usability. Through various benchmark tests, its aim to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each language in different computational scenarios. The benchmarks involve tasks like matrix multiplication, sorting algorithms, and simulations, which are commonly used in performance-critical applications.

The project contains two main directories, one for Python and one for Mojo, each containing:

Implementation directories for different algorithms being tested.
Benchmarking scripts to automate performance measurement and comparison.
